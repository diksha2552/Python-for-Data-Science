5 things happen when you give up on your dreams.



How often do you find yourself on the verge of giving up on your dreams? How often do you think you won’t be able to take it anymore?
Before you take the next step and give a final closure to all the pain you have been going through all this time to live the life of your dreams, take a step back and contemplate. Here I am just trying to give you a brief glimpse of the things that might happen if you choose to give up. Do the maths and decide for yourself!!

1.	You may end up regretting for the rest of your life
Maybe I did not try hard enough. Maybe I did not wish hard enough. Maybe just maybe I should have given it another shot… and the list is just endless. 
For the rest of your life, these are the questions you may find yourself grappling with. Looking back and wondering with helplessness and restlessness in your eyes- Do you really want to see yourself amid this situation. In all possibilities, the answer is definitely NO!
Rightly said by Walt Disney 
If you can dream it, you can do it.
Just close your eyes and ponder over how you want to see yourself five years down the line and work religiously for the same.

2.	You may end up dragging yourself every morning for the work which you never liked in the first place.
We go through three phases in our life. The first phase is childhood phase when you are just so full of life, bubbling with enthusiasm and with countless dreams in your eyes. Then comes the second phase- the grown-up phase, when you are perfectly equipped with all that you need to turn your dreams into reality. However, this is also the time when most people give up on the pursuits of their dreams. Sometimes, due to parental pressure or peer pressure, we tend to lose faith in ourselves and our dreams.
We tend to give in and drag ourselves through life doing things which we never loved in the first place.
